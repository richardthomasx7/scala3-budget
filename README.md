# Scala 3 Budget App
## Introduction
Welcome to the Scala 3 Budget App! This project was born out of a desire to tackle personal spending issues while simultaneously diving into the world of Scala 3. It serves as a testament to the power of learning through practical application, as it combines the principles of budgeting with the elegance and expressiveness of Scala 3.

## Context
### Tracking Spending 
We all know the struggle of managing finances. Whether it's tracking daily expenses, setting budgets, or gaining insights into our spending patterns, the road to financial control can be challenging. This budget app aims to simplify this process by leveraging the modern features of Scala 3 to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution. It's still a work in progress but I will be adding a web-based UI as the project develops.

### Learning Scala3

As Scala 3 is becoming more mature, I took the oppurtinity to learn about the features of Scala and how it differs from Scala2.
